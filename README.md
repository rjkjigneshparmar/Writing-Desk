## What is it?

The Writing Desk is a desktop app that acts as your personal editor. Paste any text, pick a mode, and get back a polished, improved version — with specific suggestions explaining every change.

It works with **Anthropic (Claude)**, **OpenAI (GPT)**, and **Google Gemini**. You bring your own API key. Everything runs locally on your machine.

## Features

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| **✓ Check** | Grammar, spelling, punctuation, clarity — with tone control |
| **↻ Rewrite** | Shorter, longer, more confident, simpler, and more |
| **✉ Email** | Polish drafts tuned to your recipient (boss, client, colleague, friend) |
| **⇆ Translate** | Any language → polished English (Hindi, Gujarati, Spanish, French, German) |
| **◎ Social** | Optimised for Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, SMS with character limits |

**Other highlights:**
- Side-by-side Original vs Polished comparison
- Annotated suggestions with type labels (spelling, grammar, clarity, tone)
- 2 alternative versions for every result
- Copy & Apply buttons
- Dark / light mode
- Supports 3 AI providers — switch anytime from Settings

## Building the Installer

### Windows (.exe)
```bash
npm run dist:win
```

### Mac (.dmg)
```bash
npm run dist:mac
```

Output is saved to the `release/` folder.

> **Note:** The build skips code signing by default (`CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`). Windows may show a SmartScreen warning on first launch — click **More info → Run anyway**.

## Project Structure

```
writing-desk/
├── electron/
│   ├── main.js          # Main process — window, API proxy, key storage
│   └── preload.js       # Secure IPC bridge to renderer
├── src/
│   ├── main.jsx         # React entry point
│   └── App.jsx          # Full UI — Writing Desk + Settings page

└── package.json         # Scripts and dependencies
```

## How it Works

- **Frontend:** React + Vite, served by Electron's BrowserWindow
- **API calls:** Proxied through Electron's main process via `net.request` (no CORS issues, API key never exposed to renderer)
- **Key storage:** Saved to OS user data folder (`config.json`) via Node.js `fs` — never leaves your machine except for API calls
- **IPC bridge:** `preload.js` exposes `getSettings`, `saveSettings`, and `callClaude` via `contextBridge`
